About

Digital Initiatives maintains a standalone Jamstack application that reads in and indexes IIIF presentation v3 manifests
for audio and video objects and serves them with an in house built viewer. The application is called
`canopy <https://github.com/utkdigitalinitiatives/canopy>`_.

The name is derived from a departmental mantra where we see IIIF as our "trunk." Using its many specifications, we can
serve our content to a variety of applications. Using the same mantra, we felt that we needed a "canopy" to present our
IIIF audio and video to the world and built this application.

This section describes this application and its relationship to the Rising from the Ashes project specifically.
