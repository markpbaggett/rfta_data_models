Chimney Tops II Wildfires, today

4
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.060
we have the honor of interviewing Julia Rodríguez

5
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.660
about her experience during and after

6
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
the wildfires Chimney Tops II, in 2016.

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.890
My name is Christian David Rivera and today I will be

8
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.520
conducting the interview with Julia. Julia, thank

9
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
you so much for your willingness to share your story

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.840
and experience with us. We appreciate it very much.

11
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.910
[Julia Rodriguez (NARRATOR)]: A pleasure to be here for you all.
[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you. We are going

12
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
to start with, if you can please tell me your

13
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.460
name.
[NARRATOR]: Julia Yamileth Rodríguez Sevilla.
[INTERVIEWER]: And how

14
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.840
long have you lived in Gatlinburg and can you tell us

15
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.920
how you arrived to the area? Where are you originally from?

16
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.730
[NARRATOR]: I am originally from Honduras. I moved here in

17
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.260
2000, in the-in the year 2000. I moved to this

18
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.390
city ​​because, my husband liked it, because it was a

19
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.150
small city and it had a lot of jobs.

20
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.680
[INTERVIEWER]: Okay, can you tell us a little about your life in

21
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.920
Gatlinburg for example, do you have family in the area?

22
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.280
What do you do for work and how you have you integrated yourself into the

23
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.910
community?

24
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.520
[NARRATOR]: I have, 2 siblings here. They work, my sister- a

25
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.090
sister and brother. My sister works in a

26
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.650
hotel. In a laundromat. And, well, I

27
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.420
integrated myself into this city. Ah, it was a little difficult

28
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.690
when I got here because, I realized that my

29
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.520
English wasn't, it was nothing. I lived in a world where

30
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.060
I was mute. I couldn't communicate with anyone.

31
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.660
So I decided that I had to do something.

32
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.920
I only had 2 options, one was to go back

33
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.150
to where I came from or learn the language. I went to school.

34
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.540
I went to school, brought my 2 sons because I also

35
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.510
had to take care of them. I would bring them to school, and

36
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.450
kept them close to me, where they could be

37
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.560
safe while I was taking classes. It was then that I felt

38
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.650
that I could do many things and it was easier

39
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.530
for me. And that's how I integrated myself

40
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.340
to, to the city, to jobs. I had more access to

41
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.960
many things that I didn't before. And, I got used to it.

42
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.940
I liked this city because its a small city

43
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.920
where everyone knows each other. Where there are very

44
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.990
friendly people, where there are a lot of jobs.

45
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.130
That was my life.
[INTERVIEWER]: Very well and, can you describe your

46
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.970
home and the part of town you lived in, or

47
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.800
still live in before the fires happened?

48
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.390
[NARRATOR]: When the fires happened, I had to

49
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.590
work that day. That day was a Monday I worked at

50
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.880
4 in the afternoon, but they called us from the school.

51
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.320
They told us that we had to pick up the kids from

52
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.370
Rocky Top. So the, the school-the

53
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.150
Pi Phi school, brought the kids to Rocky Top.

54
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.320
Which is in the area in which we live in.

55
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.400
We realized that the whole city

56
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.830
was, full of smoke you could no longer see, at a long

57
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.890
distance. Within 1 kilometer there was no view

58
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.880
because it was too, the air was bad

59
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
full of smoke. So I went to pick up my little boy

60
00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.640
and we came home. I stayed home I didn't

61
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.520
go to work. I cleaned my house,

62
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.660
doing daily chores. I decided I wasn't

63
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.690
going to go to work because I was afraid. I was

64
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.610
afraid because I was seeing that everyone

65
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.120
was posting videos on Facebook, that you couldn't

66
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.130
really see you couldn't breathe either. I

67
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.800
decided not to go, I called my work and said no,

68
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.910
that I wasn't, that I wasn't going to go because I was afraid. And

69
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.580
by 9 o'clock at night everyone was

70
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.320
leaving the city. Terrified because, by that

71
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.140
time, nobody had warned us. The local authorities.

72
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.660
I don't think it was on purpose, a

73
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.960
mistake, right. That was a mistake on behalf of the

74
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.200
city ​​authorities because, they never imagined

75
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.160
that a fire would get out of control and reach the center

76
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.360
of the city. So, everyone started

77
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000
calling me and telling me to leave the city but

78
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.850
the area that I live in I didn't believe that the fire

79
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.310
would come close to me. But then my brother came over

80
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.980
very terrified and, he told me, "if you don't, if you don't get out,

81
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.350
I'm going to force you out because I don't want you to

82
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.080
stay here." By the way, my son also said

83
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.910
"everyone is calling me and saying, let's go,

84
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.110
let's go." So, I saw that I had no choice. And I decided

85
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.740
that we had to leave. Also the

86
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.860
lights went out there was no electric service. By that

87
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.460
time the fire could be heard.

88
00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.520
How it devoured houses, trees. The wind was

89
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.800
aggressive, hurricane like and so when we decided

90
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.770
to look for a way out all the exits were

91
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.340
full. The cars weren't, weren't moving because

92
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.510
traffic was too heavy. So we decided

93
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.710
to take 321 which leads to Newport.

94
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.070
And it was chaos when we were headed there because

95
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.950
trees would fall and hit other cars.

96
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.920
I remember my little boy saying, "we're not going to

97
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.730
survive mommy." Because, we could see to the

98
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.010
left of us where there were some, hills.

99
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.240
When the wind would, would get

100
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.500
stronger. The flames would go up they looked like

101
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.390
15 story buildings and I could feel the heat on my

102
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.450
face. And my little boy was on the verge of

103
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.710
tears and would tell me, "we aren't going to live, we aren't, we aren't

104
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.930
going to to get out of this mommy." I was thinking

105
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.100
I'd better go back home because maybe

106
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.190
we really weren't going to survive. But I couldn't

107
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.310
go back because behind me was my brother and

108
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.230
ahead of me was my son. So I

109
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.590
thought if my son is going to die I am too. But it isn't

110
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.410
fair to my little boy. I really believe

111
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.140
in that moment all of us who were there

112
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.080
were thinking the same thing because at that

113
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.530
time, everyone was leaving town.

114
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.760
Not because the authorities came to my house and

115
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.610
said "you have to evacuate." There was no evacuation in

116
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.370
this area. If the fire had reached this house

117
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.040
perhaps, we would have been consumed. We wouldn't

118
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.350
have a home and thank God my house wasn't, wasn't

119
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.160
affected. But where my sister lived,

120
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.800
she didn't know the fire was so close.

121
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.010
But she says she heard her

122
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.420
neighbor's footsteps, running and running so hard

123
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.540
that you could feel, the sound of their footsteps. And

124
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.270
she would hear the neighbor's cars, they had 3

125
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.780
cars they just got into their cars and left. She

126
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.890
did the same with her partner. She grabbed

127
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.030
her girl and, they had 2 cars and they left. When

128
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.600
she was leaving her home she looked back, the

129
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.760
fire was already devouring her house. That

130
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.130
is something so sad that, I think that in one way or another

131
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.510
it affected, all of us. It affected us

132
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.200
financially, and also mentally. We

133
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.200
became depressed we became very sad, very

134
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.620
worried. I work in a restaurant, and well

135
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.170
Gatlinburg is a city that relies heavily on

136
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:25.500
tourism. And I remember that we didn't, we didn't have tourism.

137
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.250
Thank God we had

138
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:37.110
help from, from the bosses of, the owner of where I

139
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.410
work personally right he, really helped all of

140
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.500
his employees. I have to recognize that,

141
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.770
they helped a lot and that is something to be thankful for

142
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.390
because I think not everyone had that

143
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.050
opportunity.

144
00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:02.050
And well, I don't know I think that it affected us all a lot

145
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.590
because my little boy too, he wasn't able to

146
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.940
go back to his school. At that time, in his

147
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:16.110
class, there was a girl who had lost her life. And so

148
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.980
when they went back there was a kid missing and every day

149
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.380
he was commenting, about her that

150
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.040
she was not with them. And for some reason, they

151
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.460
went back to the old Pittman Center school. And

152
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.780
They didn't have room for them at this school.

153
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.010
So they separated them from the group that went to this

154
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.750
school. His class was separated, it was even more sad

155
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.770
for them because they were going to a place that

156
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:55.930
they didn't know and with one less student and that lasted like 30

157
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.690
days that they went to class and would always talk about her.

158
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.120
My son would ask me, "how did she die?" He'd ask what

159
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.330
the news was saying. He'd say that at school they were told,

160
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.810
"the girl fell asleep because of the smoke, that was

161
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.200
it."

162
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.330
It was probably the healthiest thing to let them think right but

163
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.820
I think it touched all of our feelings. To think

164
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.450
that this girl was no longer there, and you could see the

165
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.060
sadness on the little faces of all the kids who were going

166
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.250
to other classes. And well, thank God we have

167
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.040
recovered. Maybe this won't ever be erased from

168
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.190
our minds. But, we had to stay in

169
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.230
a hotel for a week. It was so uncomfortable.

170
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.400
Because, you have to buy food. Aside from not

171
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.830
working, we had nowhere to live

172
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.740
because no one could go into the city.

173
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:11.470
We had to move away from

174
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.180
the city, and then we went through something very

175
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.840
difficult. Our cat ran away, and we couldn't

176
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.230
find her when we did find her, we found her

177
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.980
with a lot of weight loss. But, God is great and

178
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:34.600
we are still here. Surviving, since the

179
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.260
fire, the aftermath is that in the

180
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.010
city, there isn't much housing. And when

181
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.990
you do find housing, it is the price of an

182
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.960
apartment that you once found for $400

183
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.970
Now you find it, maybe for $1,200

184
00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:02.450
Which seems to me, very unfair and, I don't know what

185
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.210
will happen in the future I hope they build more,

186
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.070
that way, there is no employee shortage and there are more

187
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.900
people, to work and well, one day it will all have to

188
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.510
go back to normal because I think we still have not

189
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.900
gone back to normal. Many people had to

190
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.510
leave the city because there was no housing.

191
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.530
It can be said, we have, survived.

192
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.710
[INTERVIEWER]: The days before the fires happened

193
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.910
or the morning before everything started

194
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.710
had you noticed smoke? You already mentioned

195
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.900
you hadn't heard any reports from the

196
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:51.300
city. But had you noticed smoke? And in what

197
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:58.370
moment did you start to worry?
[NARRATOR]: Honestly yes, yes

198
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.070
we already had knowledge of a fire, since maybe

199
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.500
3 days before. All that we heard

200
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.390
through rumors was that the fire had started, well,

201
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:18.530
a week prior. But it wasn't, it wasn't more than just

202
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.500
rumors. And really I started to worry, I think

203
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.510
not only me really everyone, everyone in the

204
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.560
city. Well, when they called us from the school

205
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.460
to go pick up our kids. Then I

206
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.360
felt something was wrong. My fear, my fear was

207
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.210
so terrifying that I, decided that I was not going to

208
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:52.230
work that day. I don't regret it because

209
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.700
my colleagues told me they were terrified

210
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.030
when they saw that, people were running in

211
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.060
the streets trying to get out of the city, because

212
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.960
they could hear the fire getting closer. The

213
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.600
restaurant doors were left open. Everything

214
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.850
was left, nothing was cleaned, everything was left lying there.

215
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.940
Can you all imagine, the fear that was felt

216
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.980
right. Of, having to run because

217
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.930
you feel the fire coming after you.

218
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.470
On the other hand, some of my colleagues

219
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.020
It was their day off, they had gone to

220
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.690
Knoxville, and when they came back, when they tried

221
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.620
to get into Gatlinburg, they saw that there was a

222
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.040
checkpoint. The police was stopping traffic

223
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.060
and they thought something had happened. They knew that

224
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.790
there was a fire in Gatlinburg but not that it was in the city.

225
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.480
So, I remember that. I have many Romanian friends

226
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.440
they told me when they tried

227
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.200
to get back in they were told "no, no you can no longer go into the

228
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.500
city, everyone has to evacuate and

229
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.380
leave the city." But they hadn't grabbed their

230
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.310
documents, they didn't have anything with them besides what they were

231
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:16.970
carrying.

232
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.510
It was terrible. And thank God, the building where

233
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.420
they live, everything around it burned, but their

234
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:33.270
building didn't burn down. Which by the way my

235
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:38.210
sister-in-law lived there too. Many of us got

236
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.250
lucky, many of my co-workers

237
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.780
lost their homes.

238
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.730
[INTERVIEWER]: And, where were you when you realized that

239
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.610
there was a forest fire raging through

240
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:59.530
Gatlinburg, and what was your initial reaction?

241
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.250
[NARRATOR]: Honestly I was at home, having a normal day

242
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:11.410
right. But when, they called us from the school

243
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.160
to go pick up my son from Rocky Top. When

244
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.150
I went up there and began to look around and saw that, there was

245
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.510
a lot of people. It was full of smoke in the surrounding areas

246
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.110
and I saw that there were journalists from

247
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.370
Knoxville newscasts.

248
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.700
I started to get scared, I started to look around and

249
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.530
I began to realize that there was wariness in

250
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.800
all the people who were there, looking for our

251
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.480
kids. I saw the school teachers

252
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.380
you could tell, they were scared

253
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:59.140
they were worried they were, you could see that that they were not

254
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.680
calm. I started to get scared.

255
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.950
I really felt a lot of fear in me. I started to realize

256
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.520
that the fire was out of control. Even

257
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.450
then, no one told us that we should, that we should

258
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.210
evacuate.

259
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:23.170
But, that day is when I decided that I was not going to

260
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:28.670
to work. On the other hand my husband did. He

261
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.720
had to go in at 4 in the afternoon and he went. And when

262
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.380
he tried to get out he couldn't, no one could get out of the

263
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.860
building where he works because, trees fell down.

264
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:46.610
By 7:00pm, there were trees in

265
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.580
the exit area. The fire was around the

266
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.350
building and no one could get out. Neither clients nor

267
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.810
employees. I asked him why he didn't leave

268
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.350
and he says because his general manager was, he was there

269
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.910
with them and said, "no, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving without

270
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.120
you all." So then they couldn't

271
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.350
leave either. And that was the reason why they stayed.

272
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.560
He really, he really thought that he would die there.

273
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.320
All the people I know who got

274
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.030
trapped in that place. They thought they were going to

275
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:29.080
die there. Because, there was no electric service, there was no

276
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.810
communication with their families. So nobody

277
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.570
knew anything about these people who got

278
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.680
trapped. Perhaps many people got

279
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.500
trapped in many places, and they are not allowed to

280
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.720
speak. We do not know. I have asked my husband if

281
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.200
they told him that they were prohibited to talk about the topic.

282
00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:54.760
He says no.

283
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:02.070
So. It was very scary and that Monday was the

284
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:07.800
day that I really found out, by myself

285
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.450
because I analyzed not because anybody told me.

286
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.290
That we were in danger, but I felt

287
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.420
safe on the one hand because I thought that. Well,

288
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.830
we live in a city where there is a lot of security,

289
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.670
where the police works very well, where there is no

290
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.570
crime, where you never hear that there is

291
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.230
river overflows, that there are landslides, that

292
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.490
there are fires, that there are, here there's never any tragedies.

293
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.710
There's never any harm from, from mother nature. So

294
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.860
I didn't, I didn't feel danger. I felt very scared

295
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.980
that day, but I thought the authorities

296
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.910
would warn us if we were at risk.

297
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.880
I think they weren't prepared.

298
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.410
That was the day that fear really started, but

299
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.650
I refused to believe that the fire was going to get into the

300
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.550
city. Or that the authorities wouldn't notify us.

301
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.010
I panicked when I saw that, everyone was

302
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.850
trying to escape. And, also many people were

303
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.420
posting videos on Facebook, on social media

304
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.960
showing that the fire was in the

305
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.740
city. They were showing areas where I know the

306
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.450
people who lived there, that their houses were burning.

307
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.670
So, it was in that moment that I

308
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.330
really felt panicked. I was always going

309
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.130
outside the house looking around. But

310
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.620
you really didn't know or had any idea where the

311
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.740
fire could come from, because the wind was so

312
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.160
strong. So at any moment

313
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.180
a branch with fire could fall around our

314
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.400
house and we could, perhaps go through a tragedy but

315
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.870
thank God that didn't happen.

316
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:23.090
[INTERVIEWER]: And after the evacuation, from Gatlinburg what was your

317
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.740
experience while waiting for them to let you

318
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.000
return to the city?

319
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:38.270
[NARRATOR]: Desperation. Honestly desperation. Because

320
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.070
no one had permission to go into the city.

321
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.590
And we, we went in without asking permission.

322
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.450
Because, thank God we live in an area that

323
00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.580
isn't in the center of the city, it is surrounding it.

324
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:08.390
So we tried to come see if

325
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.420
there was any police and if our house was

326
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.700
safe, because there was a time when

327
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.930
we didn't know. I think all of us who left,

328
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.860
didn't know if our houses had made it

329
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.400


330
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.720
So, I think desperation took a hold

331
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.240
of all of us who left the city.

332
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.170
Thinking whether we had a roof or not, because really

333
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.960
we didn't know what to do.

334
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.750
I don't know what would have happened to us if, if

335
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:54.160
our house was gone. Maybe, we would have had to go

336
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.090
live far away somewhere else. I was not

337
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.850
prepared. I'm still not ready to think that

338
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.680
something could happen to my home. Now it's worse there's no

339
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.320
housing. Well, since back then.

340
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.470
[INTERVIEWER]: How did you keep in contact with your family and

341
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:21.390
friends after the fires? Could you

342
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.960
tell us if social media played an

343
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.110
important role in maintaining communication?

344
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.420
[NARRATOR]: Social media, had it not been for

345
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.590
social media I think a lot of us wouldn't

346
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.730
have had contact or wouldn't have been,

347
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.710
able to know, if we could go back into the city or

348
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.190
not. Really all the news was through

349
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:55.860
social media. And also contact with

350
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.180
friends and family.

351
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.540
[INTERVIEWER]: Can you describe to us what the return to

352
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.620
Gatlinburg after the fires was like? What was it like seeing

353
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.150
your friends or neighbors for the first time? And the

354
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.540
experience of returning to work or

355
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.450
church? What was the experience like?

356
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.780
[NARRATOR]: In all honesty it was, a little frightening but

357
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.640
also happy at the same time to see my co-workers.

358
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.480
To know that they are there, that their

359
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.020
houses made it because although we were in contact through

360
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:45.330
social media, really no one knew if

361
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.480
their house had made it, so the first question was,

362
00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:56.180
"Did you survive? Your house, how is it? Yes, yes, yes."

363
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.480
Some, lost everything right it was very sad.

364
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:09.200
And well, there was also a little fear

365
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:15.250
because, we couldn't go back to work.

366
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.220
Our bosses came to our homes to

367
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.640
look for us, because the police only allowed

368
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.840
the owners or bosses, to go into their work place.

369
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.920
We had to clean a lot because there were

370
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.030
a lot of ashes in all the buildings that didn't

371
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.730
burn down. It couldn't be opened back to the public that

372
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.520
easily. And even though we cleaned

373
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.010
they had to hire companies to clean

374
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.070
a lot a lot of the ashes that were on the buildings.

375
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.180
So well, there was, a little bit of fear and

376
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.230
also a little emotional, to see

377
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.930
co-workers again and think that we had the

378
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.300
opportunity to return to our jobs.

379
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.340
[INTERVIEWER]: How would you evaluate the help and rescue efforts?

380
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.660
For example, first aid or

381
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:19.380
city ​​officials? Or FEMA or volunteers? What

382
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.040
is your assessment of how they handled the

383
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.110
situation?
[NARRATOR]: From 1 to 10? 0. They never came here and

384
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.170
knocked on my house they never knocked on the door to

385
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.950
see if we were okay. My sister had to be

386
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.120
homeless. I think, I don't know for how long,

387
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.770
thank God she found a place really fast but

388
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.650
not everyone had that opportunity. I know of many

389
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:55.100
families who had to share a

390
00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:01.080
2 bedroom apartment. Where 1

391
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.490
family lived with their daughter or 2 daughters and each one

392
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.720
had their own room. They had to bring in

393
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.410
2 other families to live with them. While

394
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.290
they found where to relocate because they lost

395
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.210
everything. I know they got a lot of help from, Dolly

396
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:31.580
Parton. I do know that after the fires,

397
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.980
FEMA came to the city.

398
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.170
But honestly, I don't think they were

399
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.130
prepared. I don't think they

400
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:52.320
they played a good role in this case.

401
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.880
Perhaps now they are prepared. I really don't want to

402
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.520
judge them, thinking of what it.

403
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.050
It was not that they were not prepared, but instead that, we live

404
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:10.150
in a city where, these kinds of things don't happen.

405
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.290
Nothing like that ever happens here.

406
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.900
So I don't want to judge them that they really did

407
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.810
it on purpose or that they weren't prepared

408
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.430
but, I think control was lost at the

409
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:33.330
time of the fire because. I was reading the

410
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.230
news that many people. In fact, I listened to audios

411
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.990
they would call 911, and the operators would say "do

412
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.020
whatever you think is right for you." They wouldn't tell you

413
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.040
if you should evacuate, if you should go. But I do

414
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.550
know that, the police did what they could because

415
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.510
they went to the places that were most at

416
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:03.220
risk, to knock on doors, and say, "let's go, you have to

417
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.370
leave the city." But in my house there was no

418
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.550
Red Cross or FEMA. They also didn't give a

419
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.310
phone number where we could call, people

420
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:19.360
like myself, we don't know anything about FEMA

421
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.660
we heard nothing. And my sister I do know she had help,

422
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.450
but from Dolly, from Dolly Parton.

423
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.910
[INTERVIEWER]: Emotionally, how has this incident impact-impacted you?

424
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.270
[NARRATOR]: I think, not just me

425
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.480
but everyone a lot, because, well, every time I

426
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.600
remember, it brings me a lot of sadness it makes me want to

427
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.080
cry, to to think about how our lives changed since

428
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.270
that moment. In the morning I used to drive

429
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.180
my son to his school. Then I had to

430
00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.670
drive somewhere else where only he could, go into.

431
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.330
Because they were separated from the school. His

432
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.720
class. So emotionally I think we will never

433
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.840
recover, to think that we were on the verge

434
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.740
of losing our life. I will never forget when, my

435
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.750
son told me, "we're not gonna make it." I thought

436
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.430
"is this real?" And I would roll down the window

437
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.000
the driver's window and I could feel the

438
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.590
heat on my face from the flames. I could hear, a

439
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.290
sound that, that I think I'll never in my life

440
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.810
hear again. But that must be

441
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.890
hell. It sounds like when, glass is

442
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.160
breaking. You could hear it in the fire, I really don't know

443
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.280
how to describe it. That traumatizes you for the rest

444
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.870
of your life. It's horrible to see that you're at, the mouth of

445
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.230
death. You don't know if you're living your

446
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.680
final moments, and to see my son crying saying

447
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:07.040
"mommy, we're not going to make it." But I had no choice

448
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.460
other than to try and get out. And I would think, maybe

449
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.570
by trying to run away from the fire I'm going to lead

450
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.780
my kids to lose their lives and mine as well in a

451
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.930
fire. That, is something you never recover from

452
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.580
I simply think we live trying to forget it.

453
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:35.780
[INTERVIEWER]: How did this incident affect you financially?

454
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:40.280
[NARRATOR]: Well, it affected a lot because, apart from the fact that we were

455
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:45.110
away from home, for almost a week I think. Buying

456
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:51.500
food, paying hotel. And without working, well

457
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.790
we had to spend our savings. And not only that

458
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.350
later we went back home. To throw away all

459
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.980
our food. Everything we had. Because, since

460
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.290
we had not had electric service. Well

461
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.190
a lot of food had gone bad, and so we had to buy new food.

462
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:21.240
Later, we went back to work but no one would come. We didn't

463
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:28.250
have work the way we usually do. So

464
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.010
the help we got really did help us

465
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:36.540
from the owner of the restaurant where I worked at. That's how we

466
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.440
survived.

467
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.650
[INTERVIEWER]: From your point of view, what influence, did the fires have

468
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.690
on community relations?

469
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.540
[NARRATOR]: Honestly, I

470
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.080
think they learned a lesson. I now feel

471
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.760
much safer I now feel like, this will never

472
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.200
happen again. Because they are prepared

473
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.620
all the authorities in the city are very

474
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.940
prepared. I think it was a very very

475
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.070
big lesson very painful and very big at the same time.

476
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:26.340
Because ever since, when there is rain

477
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:31.070
that lasts 3 days, school is canceled

478
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.510
because maybe there are floods that don't have too much of an impact

479
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:39.080
but for the safety of some families

480
00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.870
they cancel school and let us know.

481
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.280
We have emergency phone calls

482
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:50.750
letting us know that there are, maybe rivers, flowing out

483
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:57.230
of their channel. They are always warning us, which is something

484
00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:01.130
they never did before. So I think we can

485
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.020
live feeling better. A tragedy like, a tragedy like

486
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.890
this will never happen again. Like what

487
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.310
happened.

488
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.860
[INTERVIEWER]: Have you thought or made a plan, if in the future

489
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.040
a similar incident like this happens again?

490
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.360
[NARRATOR]: Honestly no.

491
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.250
Also there's not many options. Because

492
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.910
if a fire like this happens again, we don't have

493
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.120
another choice but to escape right. Now we are

494
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.790
more alert. Apart from that we know that the

495
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:45.530
authorities are more alert and maybe will

496
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.090
control the fire, not a week

497
00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.610
later until it gets to the city as happened

498
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.980
during the fires that destroyed the city.

499
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.750
A week had passed. They could have tried to

500
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.180
stop it before but they didn't so,

501
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.590
I really think that, no one is prepared to think

502
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.380
that there could be another fire in the city, and it could

503
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.380
attack us. Anyways we know that we shouldn't have too much trust.

504
00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.290
If I hear that there is a

505
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.630
fire in the city again, I'm going to prepare a week

506
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.300
before. I'm going to find a hotel to go to or I'm going to go

507
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.800
to another city, with time. I'm going to, I'm not going to wait

508
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.320
for the fire to reach the city. I think

509
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.550
we are all more alert.

510
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.270
[INTERVIEWER]: Is there something surprising or something good that came as a

511
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.730
result of this incident?

512
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.680
[NARRATOR]: Something good? Perhaps, realizing how vulnerable

513
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.620
we are. And also the union of the churches.

514
00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.120
We as Hispanics. There are 2 Hispanic churches

515
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.290
that are very supportive of the Hispanic community

516
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.230
here. One of them is Pastor Consuelo's

517
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:15.820
with her husband Óscar. They are a big support

518
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.750
very big in the community. They support everybody

519
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.560
it doesn't matter who you are where you come from. It doesn't

520
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.470
matter if you are not Hispanic. You are always

521
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.840
welcome. The Gatlinburg church as well.

522
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.760
So we have the church.

523
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.960
[INTERVIEWER]: We also understand that the fires

524
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.520
affected everyone. Regardless of whether you are American or

525
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:50.700
Hispanic or of another race. But specifically, how

526
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.540
do you think the fires affected the Hispanic community

527
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.400
in Gatlinburg?

528
00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:05.840
[NARRATOR]: Honestly I think it affected a lot because there was an

529
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.640
apartment building where, I think there lived.

530
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.930
It was full of many Hispanics. The entire building

531
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.100
burned down.

532
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:25.240
And many of these people would save their money, in their

533
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.230
apartments.

534
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.230
I remember hearing someone who

535
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.130
worked in the kitchen of where I worked at.

536
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:41.380
Who said they had their money because they were going to

537
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.530
buy a car. Many of them when they are going to

538
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.230
buy a car, they don't like taking on a debt.

539
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.910
They want to buy, cash. And they said they went out

540
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.910
to look for a car. They took that money with them, when

541
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.470
they came back, their apartment didn't exist.

542
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.360
So I think a lot of the Hispanics

543
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:11.740
they lost a lot of their savings. What

544
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:16.480
what affects the immigrant community most.

545
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.780
Is that they either send their money to their country or they save it, they

546
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.110
now don't keep their money in their apartments, now

547
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.800
they usually have their bank account, because

548
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.170
many lost their savings. It. It. Also

549
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:40.180
affected a lot because it was, Christmas was close and.

550
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.510
For example my sister she was saving

551
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.980
money in order to not touch her savings, and she would save her

552
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.460
money for her kid's Christmas gifts.

553
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.580
She would keep her money in the middle of her Bible. The sad thing was

554
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.120
that when she ran away, she forgot

555
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.010
her Bible. Until she was at a hotel

556
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.370
her little girl needed,

557
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.830
she was hungry, and she looked for something for her to eat in

558
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:17.120
the bags she had brought. She remembered, that she hadn't brought her

559
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.630
Bible.

560
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:24.700
And the same thing happened to a lot of people. I think that

561
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.900
this happened to a lot of people, they saved their

562
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.760
money for Christmas presents.

563
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.700
Usually we Hispanic people

564
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:40.140
we usually buy in advance, the

565
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.080
Christmas presents. So maybe some people

566
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.420
lost the gifts and others lost their money.

567
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.030
That greatly affected the immigrant community, which doesn't

568
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.220
doesn't happen with, other races.

569
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.660
[INTERVIEWER]: You previously mentioned that Gatlinburg, has a

570
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.890
problem with employment, and also housing.

571
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:09.930
Do you believe that the fires worsened

572
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:11.100
this?

573
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.490
[NARRATOR]: Before the fires there was a large workforce.

574
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.580
After the fires, there is no longer a workforce.

575
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:31.420
At every place. They are, short on staff. In all

576
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.630
areas. And the problem is because after the

577
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:42.070
fires, the few houses that survived, the

578
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.640
few apartments that were left, they are always

579
00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:52.540
full. And, there were people who went to live in other

580
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.870
cities, there are even people who left

581
00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:00.270
the county. It has affected, the fire in Gatlinburg has

582
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:06.360
affected the entire county. Because if you pass

583
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:09.940
through the city, every restaurant you pass

584
00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.250
you will see a sign in which they let you know that

585
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.010
they need employees that they are hiring, in all

586
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:21.010
positions. So, that happens because, there is no

587
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.910
housing, and what little there is, the price is

588
00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:31.890
unrealistically high. It doesn't, doesn't work for people.

589
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:36.020
tThe pay they get at jobs, is not

590
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.480
enough to pay a rent, like the type of rent

591
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.800
they offer for a house, in the county.

592
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.420
[INTERVIEWER]: And, now I want to give you the opportunity, of, if you want to

593
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.290
say something about the fires we haven't yet

594
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.280
had a chance to mention. If there is something

595
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.260
you want to say about the topic, right.

596
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.250
You can, you can talk to us about anything you'd like.

597
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:18.620
[NARRATOR]: What I think is that, a lot of people maybe. That

598
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.200
didn't experience the fires firsthand. Have no

599
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.870
idea, what it is like, to see, a wildfire right in

600
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:34.000
in front of you. And many of these people, they were left much more

601
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.560
traumatized than myself. I think nobody has been

602
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.280
interested. Nobody touches the subject. Today, it is a

603
00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:47.830
surprise that UTK takes the time right, and

604
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:55.310
wants to talk about the topic. Because, it's, it's something, that

605
00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.070
everyone tries to, turn the page on. But

606
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:06.040
nevertheless, I know that many people, face

607
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.250
the consequences of this. I do not understand why

608
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.560
nobody cares to

609
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.230
talk about the subject and seek a solution to

610
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.030
housing and high prices, of which there is no

611
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:28.580
control over. I think that affects us all. Because

612
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.060
hardworking people that want to buy a

613
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.770
property. Find the prices

614
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:41.230
in the area to be ridiculous. Its as if you lived in

615
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:45.520
New York, but we don't live in New York, we live

616
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.090
in Gatlinburg and I don't understand why the authorities don't

617
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.180
do anything about it. They don't create homes,

618
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.950
aid centers for the survivors

619
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:58.580
of the wildfires.

620
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.340
A place where you can go and read a

621
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.610
book, inform yourself about the fire doesn't exist. There is no

622
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:14.590
place where you can, know what to do. Prepare

623
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:19.440
yourself. Us locals who

624
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.430
live here, we have no information regarding what

625
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:24.690
to do, where to go.

626
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.920
There is no information. So, it would be good

627
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.890
for someone to bring it up. Like a ring to a

628
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:41.370
bell, let's do something. As far as

629
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.530
I know, you all are the only ones who

630
00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.940
are talking about the subject which makes me, makes me feel

631
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.750
surprised.

632
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.190
I don't know what else to add.

633
00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.140
[INTERVIEWER]: And with that our interview concludes, and

634
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:05.180
on behalf of, of me, Drew, Casey and the UTK

635
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.260
Libraries, we want to say thank you very much for

636
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:12.100
taking the time to do this interview and

637
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.270
letting us interview you and telling your

638
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:20.300
experience. So we thank you very much.
[NARRATOR]: At your

639
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:20.690
order.
